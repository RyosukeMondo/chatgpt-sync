I want to have send to path button similar to copy to clipboard button.

I'm building chrome extension using pnpm react.
I can browse code, have copy to clip board button.
when send to path clicked, send code contents to native app build by go lang.
go lang receives path and code, save to the path code contents.

tell me how to extend my current implementation, and newly build go lang receives path and code as argument, save to path.
